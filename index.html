			<div class="p1">
			<p>I've always been a passionate dreamer because "dream big" that's what they say, So I have plenty of dreams which I have turned into real goals that I'm looking to achieve, I'll mention some of these goals in the next paragraph and how the academy can help me reach these goals.</p>
			<p>
			I want to become a professional full-stack web developer, Android developer, Work on AI and ML projects, Create something that will make a huge impact on the world we are living in, Solve real-world problems and help others with my programming skills, Work on or be a part of something bigger than me and last but not least I hope to get a job at Google because that has been my dream for a very long time now, To work with like-minded people and change the world.</p>
			<p>
			Being in the academy will help me concentrate more on these goals, By giving all my time for the thing that I love doing, Work with people who know  more about programming than me, Get more experience by finishing large projects, This all will definitely let me reach to my dream job which is working at Google.</p>
